Do you ever struggle as a Technical Writer, and wonder how things could get easier? 

Though Technical Writing isnâ€™t a well known profession, outside of Tech, to those of us working in the tech industry, it is no secret that Technical Writing is an entirely different species of skill. It can be one of the most difficult types of writing you can do, as it often requires understanding of some softwares and programming languages & frameworks. 

As a result, writers in this field face many challenges that can make the process of producing clear and concise content even harder. This can cause problems such as poor user experience for writers, inconsistencies in documentation, and poor Search Engine Optimization(SEO). 

Thankfully, technical writing has become such a widely popular profession and necessity among software solutions companies, that several different resources and tools were created to  overcome those challenges and allow the production of content much easier, faster, and maintainable.
